<b>Hello! Ciao! 你好</b>

My name is Pasquale Lobascio, and I am a Master's graduate in Life Science Informatics.
I was born in Terlizzi, Italy in 2000. After obtaining my high school diploma at "Sen. O. Jannuzzi" in Andria in 2019, I moved to Rome to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at "La Sapienza" University of Rome. I then continued my academic journey at the University of Helsinki, where I completed my Master's Degree in Life Science Informatics.

During my studies in Helsinki, I had the privilege of conducting my thesis research at the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM) as part of the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/in-silico-drug-discovery/group-members"> In-Silico Drug Discovery</a> group. During that year, I also participated with the group in the <a href="https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn65660836/wiki/631410">SYNAPSE DREAM Target 2035 Drug Discovery Challenge</a>. My passion for this field began in high school, when I fell in love with biotechnologies, medicine and machine learning. Since then, I have been driven by the desire to merge these two worlds—using computational power to solve biological problems.

I aim to contribute to research that has real-world applications and a meaningful impact on human health and well-being, or on our understanding of our biology. My research interests span AI applications in drug discovery, translational biomedicine, neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry, as well as data science algorithms and theory. I'm particularly drawn to methodologies such as machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, generative AI, and genetic programming. My interests keep expanding, and I'm always open to exploring new directions!

I have a passion for working out, singing, writing, and languages. My interests that span both science and the arts. On the scientific side, I am fascinated by chemistry, data science theory, and biotechnologies. Artistic interests include martial arts, dance, learning Chinese and Thai languages, playing instruments, music theory, and much more.

I am currently learning Chinese through self-study and offer Italian language lessons for English speakers <a href="https://www.superprof.fi/italian-native-speaker-and-writer-will-teach-you-italian-for-beginner-intermediates-and-advanced.html">here</a>.
