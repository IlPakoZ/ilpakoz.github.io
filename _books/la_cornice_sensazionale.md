In 2020, I wrote and self-published a poetry book titled "La cornice sensazionale. Il dolore dell'innocente cantato senza musica" as both a form of self-expression and a challenge to step outside my comfort zone. At the time I was in Rome. Home sickness, loneliness, isolation, overthinking and burnout, blending in during a complex moment of my life, were making me feel overwhelmed. Through poetry and writing I was able to let off steam and simultaneously communicate with people next to me. I transformed the pressure inside into something external, creative and concrete, helping me recover and improve my state of mind. I translate the book summary description here.

"There are moment in life when one surrenders to the tides of sensations. One find oneself in a state of perpetual disequilibrium between freedom and overwhelm. In those situations, survival instinct takes over while your inside pours out, raw and innocent as it is, as a river of words, sounds and pictures, which allow one to see the world through one's personal Sensational Frame. This vision materializes through a collection of songs without music, juxtapositions of words that project on pages the sensational dimension of an individual, but at the same time, a person among many, almost unknown, in a painful and often desolate society."

The book has been self-published through <a href="https://www.streetlib.com/">StreetLib</a>, and is available on different sellers, including <a href="https://www.lafeltrinelli.it/cornice-sensazionale-dolore-dell-innocente-libro-pasquale-lobascio/e/9788835832461">_La Feltrinelli_</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Cornice-Sensazionale-dolore-dellinnocente-cantato/dp/8835832462">_Amazon_</a> and <a href="https://www.ibs.it/cornice-sensazionale-dolore-dell-innocente-libro-pasquale-lobascio/e/9788835832461">_IBS_</a>.
